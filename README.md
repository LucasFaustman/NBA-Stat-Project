## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

This was my first time fetching data from existing APIs! I used Javascript to fetch data from balldontlie API as well as sportsdb. I focused on making an easily digestible front page where users can see information about their favorite players.

## Optimizations

I spent a large amount of time optimizing the app for mobile so that users can see the description and averages easily. I will further work on potentially adding a loading icon so that if there is a long response time to fetch the API, the user won't be left in the dark.

## Lessons Learned:

Don't forget about styling! Getting the data from the APIs was relatively easy, but presenting the data in a way to delight users was a challenge.
